- Broadened number of cases in which head misplacement is detected
- Workaround for false z-min endstop triggerings

Fix 1.0.0096.1 (2016-11-22)
---------------------------
- Increased MAX TEMP value for different heads

Rev 1.0.0096 (2016-11-22)
-------------------------
- Fixed G27/G28 behaviour near axis limits and silenced verbose error messages
- Fixed G29 hitting Y endstop
- Changed M503 and other diagnostic outputs
- Fixed THERMISTOR_INPUT_HOTSWAP interference with heaters management

Rev 1.0.0095.1 (2016-05-02)
---------------------------
- Fixed a bug with timing when using M3,M4,M5
- Subtractive gcodes will not require a G4 before M5 or after M3 and M4 like before..
  M3,M4 and M5 will in fact start spinning after 1.5 seconds the last movement operation is completed.
  This allows to use some standard Gcode Posts processors instead of manually editing the code with pauses

Rev 1.0.0095 (2016-04-22)
-------------------------
- Default Baud rate changed to 250000 bps.
- General Error management & Endstop management revamp.
- Changed sound notifications
- Moved G28 homing position to the effective center of the build area point of rotation when setting the screws.The point is in the center of the print area in the V2 heated bed.
- Fixed G28 inability to probe the center of the work-area when z_max_endstop is triggered
- Sounds alerts revamp to be more clear, silent mode can be triggered on some commands that usually emit sound.
  - M735 S1-0 enable /disable silent mode (less beeps all around)
- If door safety is enabled, opening the door will trigger an instant emergency stop of all movement and routines, reverting the unit to a safe situation. Door safety can still be enabled or disabled from the FABUIÂ’s settings>hardware menu.
- Inactivity timer changed to 10 minutes for longer heating times.
- Fan management for V1 and V2 heads (SELECTABLE_AUTO_FAN_ON_TEMP_CHANGE behaviour modified: V2 heads won't have mandatory auto-cooling unless wanted, while V1 will have auto-cooling unless configured as disabled.) This reduces the heating time with V2 heads while avoiding clogging due to prolonged overheating in V1 heads.
- Added optional external power supply shutdown procedure (M786).
- Added new error codes. Min_temp extrusion now is triggered on the FABUI as well:
  - ERROR_AMBIENT_TEMP 122 (when ambient temp is < extruder_0_mintemp
  - ERROR_EXTRUDE_MINTEMP 123 (when cold extrusion is triggered, M302 S0
  - to disable)
  - ERROR_LONG_EXTRUSION 124 (when extruding too much!)
- Added command M793 to set the installed head version (dev only).
  - All codes related to the head have been discontinued in favour of a single ID.

- Improved reactivity on Stop command for a failure
- changed displayed error after endstop hit (changed to "106" error code for Xmax,"107" for Xmin,"108" for Ymax, "109" for Ymin, instead of general kill error code "100")

  Y coordinates signs

  opening permanently (M732 S0->disable(unsafe),M732 S1->enable(safe))

Rev 1.0.004 (29/09/2014)
------------------------
- updated G30 to probe at max z=(probe length-1mm)

  machine has been turned on without head (for testing purpose only)

Rev 1.0.003 (22/09/2014)
------------------------
- changed M730 behavior, now command does not clear error ack signal
  (only M999 clear the error ack signal)

  (changed to "102" error code instead of general kill error code "100")

Rev 1.0.002 (26/09/2014)
------------------------
- changed Z axis speed for G27 command (6 times faster)
- changed probing point for z for homing z (from bottom left to
  center-center)
- changed maximum probing height is 1mm closer than factory stored
  zprobe_offset (safer to avoid damage after probe malfunction)
