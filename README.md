   FABlin Firmware
=====================
for **FABtotum Personal Fabricator** and **FABtotum Core** platforms

This is FABlin, a Marlin derivative firmware. Marlin was originally
created by Erik Zalm (https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin). The changes
made are focused on multipurpose personal fabrication and hardware
characteristics of the FABtotum Personal Fabricator such as 3D/4 Axis
milling, 3D/4 axis scanning, Touch-probing and the Totumduino Board
I/Os capabilities.


Compiling
---------

### with Arduino IDE

To correctly compile the firmware with Arduino you must set the
repository root foler as Arduino's *sketchbook folder*
inside Arduino's preferences. Alternatively you can manually copy the
[FABlin/libraries/SmartComm](libraries/SmartComm) folder into your
current sketchbook's *libraries* folder.

For further info refer to
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#toc7.


### with PlatformIO

A default `platformio.ini` file with correct directories definitions is
now included in the repository. To compile the firmware simply run:

    platformio run

inside this repository's root folder. To upload the firmware on the board
or flash it directly into it refer to
[platformio documentation](http://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/userguide/cmd_run.html).
`platformio.ini` has a default definition for using an AVRISP-mk2 usb
programmer. To directly flash the firmware onto TOTUMduino using that
defintion, run:

    platformio run -t program

  - Revised heaters numbering:
    - 0: bed heater
    - 1: head heater
    - 4: bed temp sensor with disabled heater
    - 5: head temp sensor with disabled heater
